- This is a smart token contract build using the solidity programming language and this is my project for the ETH Proof: Intermediate EVM course module 3.
- We can connect it with the metamask wallet and use this token for transactions i.e we can mint, send and burn this token.
- This token contract is build using the templates from the OpenZeppelin library.
- My token name is StrawHatCrew and it's symbol is SHC.
- I have already minted 1000 token.
- We can copy paste the code on Remix IDE and can deploy this contract.
